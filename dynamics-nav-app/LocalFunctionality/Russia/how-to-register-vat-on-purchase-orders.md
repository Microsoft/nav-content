In Russia, organizations are required to keep a journal of received and issued VAT invoices. [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)] enables you to register VAT on purchase orders so that the information is tracked in the VAT invoices journal.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Order**, and then choose the related link. Select the relevant purchase order.  
2. On the **Shipping** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  


   |          Field           |                       Description                        |
   |--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Vendor Receipts No.**  | Enter the identification number from the vendor receipt. |
   | **Vendor Receipts Date** |         Enter the date from the vendor receipt.          |


3. On the **VAT** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
