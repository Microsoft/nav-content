# How to: Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can correct or cancel a posted sales invoice by issuing a corrective credit memo. This is useful if you make a mistake or if the customer requests a change.

In the **Posted Sales Invoice** window, you can choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action to achieve the effect of cancelling or correcting the sales invoice. For more information, see [How to: Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).
